General steps to upgrade a functional v1.1 database to v1.2:

1. Run django's manage.py syncdb command
2. Run three south migration commands:
    -- manage.py migrate profiles --fake
    -- manage.py migrate treemap --fake
    -- manage.py migrate api
3. Create a view for geoserver to only load existing plots:
    -- create view present_plot as (select id, geometry from treemap_plot where present=True)
